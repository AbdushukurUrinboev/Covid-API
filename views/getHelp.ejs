                            Manage stress for health 
                        </h3>
                        <p> While we take action to lessen the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on our communities and our health care systems, it is also important to minimize the secondary health effects of this pandemic. Widespread stress and anxiety regarding COVID-19, compounded by the economic distress due to lost wages, employment and financial assets; mass school closures; and necessary physical distancing measures can result in an increase of stress-related health conditions.  

                        </p>

                                Supportive relationships: Maintain supportive relationships wherever you can, including virtually.

                                Exercise: Engage in 60 minutes of physical activity every day, if you can. It doesnâ€™t have to be all at one time.  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sleep: Get sufficient, high-quality sleep. This may be particularly hard right now, but going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day can help. 
                            </li>
